# A little bit about myself.

Hi, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Justin, and I am a video editor and graphics designer. As you can see from the design of this site, I am also a novice at coding at website development.

## Skills and Proficiencies.

The following is a list of applications and services that I am proficient at. 

### Adobe Premiere Pro & Adobe After Effects

I have had more than 4 years of experience with working with Premiere Pro and After Effects. I have used both applications to edit a wide range of video projects I've worked on in the past, such as Short films, Video Essays, and Montages.

### Adobe Photoshop & Adobe Lightroom

I have always had a keen eye and passion for Graphics Design and Image Manipulation. I am adamant in using serif fonts such as Helvetica or San Francisco. I have used Photoshop for over 5 years, mainly to design Graphics and Posters for different projects. However, occasionally, I may use Photoshop to edit a friend's face, or edit images to post online.

### Microsoft Office Suite

_Microsft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Publisher_

Since primary school, I have used the Microsoft Office to complete homework assignments or write essays. I have more than 7 years of experience with these applications.
